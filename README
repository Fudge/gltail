glTail.rb - http://www.fudgie.org

I know, horrible code and global variables, and what not. But, it works,
and it's too fun to watch my servers traffic in real time to clean up
everything before releasing it.

Configuration:
  Open config.yaml in a text editor, and tweak to your liking. You might want to save the
  result to another file, and include that on the command line.
  Either include a password for each of your servers, or make sure your ssh-keys are
  correctly set up.

  If you need to specify a SSH key replace
    password: secret
  with
    keys: /path/to/key

Running:
  ./gl_tail.rb <config.yaml>

  You can also press 'f' while running to toggle the attempted frames per second.
